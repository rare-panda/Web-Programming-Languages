On an html page, provide a form for the user to enter an address. When the user clicks on the “Search” button:

	- Using Google Maps API, first find the latitude and longitude for the given address (Geocoding Service) and then find all nearby restaurants (within 1500 meters) for that latitude and 
	  longitude (Places Library, nearbySearch function).

	- Show/mark restaurants on Google maps.

Note:
You will need a valid API key for using Google Maps. Do not use the one given in hands-on example. Follow the instructions below to create a new API key. 
When you create the key, it gives you $300 credit for free trial and $200 recurring credit for each month. You can share your key with a trusted circle of friends (so that not everyone will need to create a key and give their credit card number).
